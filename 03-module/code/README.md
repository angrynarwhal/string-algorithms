1. The `suffix-array.py` file can be run using `python3 suffix-array.py`. 
2. The `suffix_arrays.ipynb` file is a Jupyter Lab Notebook. To run it, you need to: 
  - Create a python3 virtual environment `python3 -m venv ~/.module3` followed by 
  - `source ~/.module3/bin/activate` followed by
  - `jupyter lab` executed from your command line.
