# Module Two Homework: 

(Edit distance) In order to transform one string x to a target string y, we can perform various edit operations. Our goal is, given x and y, to produce a series of edits that change x to y. We may choose from among edit operations:

1. Insert a letter, (e.g., changing 100 to 1001 takes one insertion) 
2. Delete a letter, (e.g., changing 100 to 10 takes one deletion)
3. Replace a letter by another (e.g., you need do one replacement to change 100 to 000).
Design an efficient algorithm that finds a series of edit operations that change x to y and the total number of edits is minimized.

Explain your algorithm's efficiency, and which ideas you applied from the fasta, four russians, Hirschberg, and dynamic edit distance algorithms in plain english such that a non-computer science human will understand.
